  It is true that Intel has not improved a lot in their **CPU** architecture in
  the past five years, which is why they had to increase the core count in the
  processors to compete with AMD Ryzen processors. This increase in core count
  was first seen in the 8th generation Intel processors, where all the three
  series (Core i3, i5, and i7) of processors had gotten two more cores,
  resulting in four, and six cores respectively. 


  When AMD released its 2nd generation processors back in 2018, Intel upped their game again and increased the core count in the Core i7 processors, leading to eight cores. These processors turned out to be quite powerful processors, however, Hyperthreading was removed from the Core i7 processors of the 9th generation. 


  **Intel Core i7-9700K** is the unlocked variant of the Core i7 processor from the 9th generation and provides eight cores and since there is no HyperThreading involved, it provides eight threads as well.


  The processor has a base clock of 3.6 GHz and a turbo clock of 4.9 GHz. This makes it one of the best processors for gaming due to high core count and high operating frequency. It comes with Intel UHD Graphics 630 as integrated graphics, has an L3 cache of 12 MB and a TDP of 95 watts.


  The best thing about this processor is that it is one of the fastest processors for gaming because of high single-core performance. The performance is even higher than the 3rd generation AMD Ryzen processors and that is why those people who want the ultimate performance prefer to buy this processor instead of AMD Ryzen 3700X or 3800X.


  In this article, we will be listing some of the best motherboards that you can couple with this processor for the ultimate gaming experience.


  We have listed the **8 Best motherboard for i7 9700K** in the following table.

      ASUS is a popular manufacturer of motherboards and is known for designing
      some of the most powerful motherboards of all time. Their ROG MAXIMUS
      series is targeted towards the enthusiast community and is based on
      Z-series chipsets for the Intel platform.


      ASUS ROG MAXIMUS XI HERO is one of the finest motherboards for Intel’s mainstream processors right now and is capable of running even the most powerful processors at the highest possible clock speeds.


      The price of the motherboard is surely higher than the other motherboards based on Z390 chipset, however, it is worth every penny if you are someone who wants to juice every bit of performance. 


      First of all, the looks of this **motherboard** are pretty impressive, as expected of ASUS Republic Of Gamers. The motherboard mainly uses black color for the PCB while there is RGB lighting on the heat-sink at the I/O panel cover and the chipset heat-sink.


      The lighting on the I/O cover does not have any logo but the lighting on the chipset has the ROG logo which greatly enhances the looks of the system. The heat-sinks on the VRM are very nice-looking as well and have HERO written on them. The RGB lighting can be controlled through the software application and it supports ASUS AuraSync as well.


      ASUS ROG MAXIMUS XI HERO is an ATX motherboard and comes with four DIMM slots, which means that with the use of 32 GB sticks you can reach a maximum memory limitation of 128 GB. As for the PCI Express slots, there are five of them, among which three are PCI Express 3.0 X16 and three are 3.0 X1.


      This seems like a great configuration, where you can install lots of PCI-E devices such as multiple graphics cards, PCI-E SSDs, sound cards, etc. As for the M.2 slots, there are two of them, both being covered by large heat-sinks. The motherboard provides six SATA III ports, capable of running at 6Gb/s.


      Coming to the I/O of the motherboard, it offers 6 x audio ports, 2 x WiFi antenna ports, 2 x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports, 3 x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports, 1 x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port, 2 x USB 2.0 ports (one of which is used for BIOS), an HDMI port, a DP port, a PS/2 port, a BIOS Flashback button, and a Clear CMOS button.


      These options seem very extensive and are quite helpful during various scenarios, especially the BIOS related functions. ASUS has used ROG SupremeFX in the motherboard with the audio codec S1220, which is greatly appreciated for its quality and outputs.


      The motherboard also supports Bluetooth and WiFi, where ASUS has used Intel Wireless-AC 9560 for WiFi, capable of running at 1.73 Gbps. As for the multi-GPU support, the motherboard supports 2-way NVIDIA SLI and 3-way AMD CrossFireX technology. There is a total of seven fan headers in the motherboard including the CPU and AIO pump headers.


      The power delivery of this motherboard is quite controversial. ASUS implemented a new design for the VRM and used a big 4+2 phase power delivery, however, this VRM is much better than previously used 4+2 phase VRM in the cheap motherboards. That is why you can overclock the processors like Intel Core i7-9700K or even Core i9-9900K at high frequencies like 5.0+ GHz, etc.


      #### **Conclusion:**


      ASUS ROG MAXIMUS XI HERO is one of the best motherboards for those people who want to get high performance but yet not spend as much money as it would take for MAXIMUS XI FORMULA.


      The looks of the motherboard are pretty good and with great RGB lighting, it enhances the looks of your rig. With great I/O features like integrated high-performance WiFi, lots of PCI-E slots, etc., you get ease of access and don’t have to spend extra for these features.
    pros:
      - Awesome looks
      - Great performance
      - Lots of features
    cons:
      - Somewhat expensive
